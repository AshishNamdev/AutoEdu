"""
AutoEdu Portal Automation Entrypoint.

This module serves as the centralized launcher for automation workflows across multiple
educational portals, including UDISE, MPBSE, and Education Portal 3. It dynamically
routes execution based on configuration parameters defined in `common.config`, allowing
for modular and scalable automation of student and teacher workflows.

Features:
    - Launches browser session using configured URL.
    - Initializes logging and configuration setup.
    - Delegates portal-specific tasks based on `PORTAL`, `MODULE`, and `TASK` values.
    - Supports future expansion for additional workflows and portals.

Usage:
    Configure `PORTAL`, `MODULE`, and `TASK` in `common/config.py` before execution.

Example:
    PORTAL = "udise"
    MODULE = "student"
    TASK = "import"

    Running this script will launch the browser and execute the student import workflow
    for the UDISE portal.
