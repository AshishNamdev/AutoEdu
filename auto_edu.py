"""
AutoEdu Portal Automation Entrypoint.

This module serves as the centralized launcher for automation workflows
across multiple, educational portals, including UDISE, MPBSE, and
Education Portal 3 It dynamically routes execution based on configuration
parameters defined in `common.config`, allowing for modular and scalable
automation of student and teacher workflows.

Features:
    - Launches browser session using configured URL.
    - Initializes logging and configuration setup.
    - Delegates portal-specific tasks based on `PORTAL`, `MODULE`,
        and `TASK` values.
    - Supports future expansion for additional workflows and portals.

Usage:
    Configure `PORTAL`, `MODULE`, and `TASK` in `common/config.py
    before execution.

Example:
    PORTAL = "udise"
    MODULE = "student"
    TASK = "import"

    Running this script will launch the browser and execute the student
    import  for the UDISE portal.
