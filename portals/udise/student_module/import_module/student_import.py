"""
Automates the UDISE Student Import workflow using Selenium.

This module handles authentication and UI interactions required to initiate
and execute student data import tasks within the UDISE portal. It leverages
modular UI components and centralized configuration for secure credential handling.

Features:
    - Logs into the UDISE portal using provided credentials.
    - Initializes the student import UI workflow.
    - Provides hooks for future expansion of import logic.

Usage:
    Instantiate `StudentImport` and call `init_student_import()` to begin the import process.
