"""
Release Request workflow orchestrator for UDISE Student Module.

This module coordinates the release request process for a batch of students
using the UDISE UI automation layer. It delegates UI interactions to
`ReleaseRequestUI` and manages student-specific data flow.

Usage:
    - Instantiate `ReleaseRequest` with a list of student objects.
    - Call `start_release_request()` to initiate the release request flow.

Includes:
    - UI navigation and form filling for release requests
    - Student data extraction and submission coordination
