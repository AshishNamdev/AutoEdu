Module: student_import_locator

Defines locator tuples for UI elements used in the UDISE Student Import module.
These locators are used to identify and interact with specific components on
the web interface, such as the Student Movement and Progression option and
the Import module.

Dependencies:
- selenium.webdriver.common.by.By: for specifying locator strategies
- ui.selectors.udise.StudentImportSelectors:
  contains XPath strings for UI elements

    Locator definitions for elements in the UDISE Student Login interface.

    This class provides static tuples that map UI components to their
    corresponding selectors, enabling automated interaction with login fields,
    CAPTCHA input, error messages, and post-login navigation elements such as
    academic year selection and school information dialogs.

    Usage:
        - Use with Selenium's `find_element` or `find_elements` to interact
          with login-related UI components.
        - Integrate into page object models for maintainable test automation.
        - Pair with `StudentLoginSelectors` to separate semantic meaning from
        structural location.

    Includes:
        - Login form fields: Username, Password, CAPTCHA
        - Action buttons: Submit
        - Error handling: Alert messages
