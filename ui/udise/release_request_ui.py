"""
UI automation for UDISE Release Request workflow.

This module provides a class interface to automate the Release Request
process in the UDISE Student Module. It interacts with key UI components
to select request options, fill student details, and trigger release actions.

Usage:
    - Instantiate `ReleaseRequestUI` to access workflow methods.
    - Use `select_release_request_options()` to navigate to the release request
      form.
    - Use `generate_release_request(pen_no, dob)` to populate and submit
      student data.

Includes:
    - UI navigation for release request options
    - Form filling for student PEN and DOB
    - Logging and delay handling for UI stability
